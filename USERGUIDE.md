## Deployment

Starting in the the top directory of the cloned repository.

restore C# dependencies and build SGame (integrated FxCop analysis)

```C#
dotnet restore SGame
```

```C#
dotnet build SGame
```

### Running the server
A SArbiter instance needs to be started:

```sh
dotnet run --project SArbiter -- --api-url "http://<restAddress>/" --bus-port <The UDP port to use for the master event bus>
```
where `restAddress` is the externally-visible IPv4 address or hostname from where to serve the REST API to clients from.

This is the node the clients connect to.

The system then needs at least on compute node attached to the arbiter (max. one per physical address). One can be started by:

```sh
dotnet run --project SGame -- --arbiter <Hostname or address of the SArbiter managing this compute node> --api-url "http://<restAddress>/" --arbiter-bus-port <Externally-visible UDP port of the arbiter's event bus> --local-bus-port <Externally-visible UDP port of this node's event bus> --tickrate <Frequency of updates in milliseconds>
```
where `restAddress` is a externally-visible (including to other SGame nodes and the arbiter) IPv4 address or hostname (clients are redirected to this HTTP server from the arbiter).  

SArbiter and SGame instances can be killed by sending a post request as shown:
```sh
curl -X POST -d "exit" "http://<api-url>/exit"
```

Where the api-url is the address used to start the node.

### Data persistency
Optionally, if persistence is to be enabled, one can pass a `--persistence http://<elastic>/` flag when launching SGame, to instruct it to use the ElasticSearch server at `<elastic>`.

## Running the tests

Automated tests can be executed as such:

restore C# dependencies and build SGame (integrated FxCop analysis)

```C#
dotnet restore SGame
```

```C#
dotnet build SGame
```

Running the command below runs the automated Xunit tests

```C#
dotnet test
```

The second set of automated testing which can be executed are the pytests (Black box tests)

```bash
bash ci/runtests.sh ${SGAME_HOST} ${SGAME_PORT}
```

where SGAME_HOST is the host for the test SGame instance and SGAME_PORT is the port for the test SGame instance

### Xunit tests

The Xunit tests include testing on geometry (scanning, shielding and shooting) and more. The tests were created to test the internal structure of the application.

Below is an example Xunit test:

```csharp
//Test case 1: Attacker is within defending ship. No damage should be shielded.

            gameTime.Reset();
            ship = new Spaceship(1, gameTime);
            ship.Pos = new Vector2(2, 1); //Start ship at (2,1) to avoid missing bugs due to simplicity of (0,0)
            shipRadius = 10;
            ship.Area = shipRadius * shipRadius * Math.PI;

            yield return new object[] { ship, shotOrigin = new Vector2(5, 5), shotDir = -126.869897645844, shotWidth = 1, (ship.Pos - shotOrigin).Length(), expectedValue = 0.0 };

```

### pytest tests

The pytest were created to simulate testing in live manner i.e black box test. Where we would be focus solely on the inputs and outputs with respect to our game specifcation.

For example the test belows ensures that getShipInfo retrieves the correct inital state of the spaceship (without caring about the internals)

```python
def test_getShipInfo_intial_state(clients):
    """
    Tests if getShipInfo matches the intial state of the ship
    """
    with clients(1) as client:
        resp = requests.post(client.url + 'getShipInfo', json={
            'token': client.token,
        })
        assert resp
        resp_data = resp.json()
    # Ensures that the intial values match the information from getShipInfo
        assert resp_data["area"] == 1
        assert resp_data['energy'] == 10
        assert resp_data['posX'] == 0
        assert resp_data['posY'] == 0
        assert resp_data['velX'] == 0
        assert resp_data['velY'] == 0
        assert resp_data['shieldWidth'] == 0
        assert resp_data['shieldDir'] == 0
```
